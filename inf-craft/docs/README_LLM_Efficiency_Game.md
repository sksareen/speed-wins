# LLM Efficiency Infinite Craft Game

## Overview

This is a discovery-based learning game that teaches LLM efficiency concepts through an "infinite craft" style interface. You start with basic mathematical foundations and combine concepts to discover more advanced topics in LLM efficiency.

## Files

- `llm_efficiency_concepts.json` - Structured database of all LLM efficiency concepts with relationships
- `llm_efficiency_game.py` - The main game executable
- `llm_efficiency_learning_roadmap.md` - Comprehensive learning roadmap
- `llm_efficiency_practical_guide.md` - Hands-on implementation guide

## How to Play

### Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed
2. Make sure both `llm_efficiency_concepts.json` and `llm_efficiency_game.py` are in the same directory
3. Run the game:

```bash
python llm_efficiency_game.py
```

### Game Mechanics

**Starting Concepts:**
- Linear Algebra
- Calculus  
- Probability

**Goal:** Discover all 50+ concepts by combining mathematical foundations and neural network principles.

**Scoring:**

## Using the Database for Other Tools

The JSON database can be loaded into various tools:

### Python
```python
import json

with open('llm_efficiency_concepts.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Access concepts
concepts = data['concepts']
relationships = data['relationships']
categories = data['categories']
```

### Database Import
The structure is designed to be easily imported into:
- SQLite/PostgreSQL databases
- Graph databases (Neo4j)
- Knowledge graph tools
- Learning management systems

### API Integration
The JSON structure can be used to build:
- REST APIs for concept lookup
- Recommendation systems
- Learning path generators
- Progress tracking systems

## Educational Value
