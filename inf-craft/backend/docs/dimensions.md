# folds: 3D as a fold of 2D

what if 3d is not a separate realm but a behavior of 2d under folding.
conversion isn't extrusion; it's curvature + constraint. a crease is a rule.

---

## core claim

**3d phenomena emerge when a 2d substrate is folded under consistent rules.**
- **surface first**: start with a sheet (information plane, field, manifold)
- **crease pattern**: apply local constraints (symmetry, energy minima, adjacency)
- **fold operation**: produce curvature; self-contact encodes interactions
- **result**: apparent volume, thickness, depth — all emergent labels on a sheet



if this is right, conversion is literally: define the crease grammar; apply it.

---

## quick analogies that keep showing up

- **origami physics**: one sheet → cranes, boxes, tessellations. no new matter, just new rules.
- **holography vibes**: boundary data determining bulk behavior. information at the edge, depth as bookkeeping.
- ** textiles/biology**: folding proteins = function. misfolds = disease. geometry decides meaning.
- **cartography/inversion**: maps flatten terrain; folds re-inflate it. projection vs re-projection.

## minimal mechanics of a fold

if we strip it down, a fold needs:
- **support**: the plane we allow to bend (2d field of values)
- **crease set**: a finite set of directions/lines where curvature can concentrate
- **compatibility**: folds don't tear; metrics change, topology stays (mostly) stable
- **energy rule**: the configuration that minimizes tension becomes "real"

the rest is emergent vocabulary: edges, corners, cavities, layers, occlusion.

## theories

**theory A: holographic intuition**
- depth is a coordinate we invented to track long-range constraints among 2d relations.
- change the boundary grammar → you rewrite the sense of inside/outside.

**theory B: compression-as-creation**
- folding is lossy visibility, not lossy information. you hide to encode.
- multiple layers = multiplexing: same plane, different addresses through occlusion.

**theory C: routing over computation**
- the intelligence is in where you put creases, not how hard you push the paper.
- routing rule > force magnitude. structure beats power.

---

## questions to sharpen the claim

- **where does thickness come from?**
  - perceptual artifact of stacked layers? or a true metric change?
- **what counts as a tear?**
  - if interaction requires new topology, is the model broken or extended?
- **is time another fold direction?**
  - is motion the progressive revelation of a crease sequence?
- **how small is the crease grammar?**
  - reflect, rotate, translate, pinch? is there a minimal universal set?

---

## conversion rules (first pass)

- **identify the plane**: what 2d substrate are we folding? signals, symbols, states.
- **specify creases**: constraints from symmetry, conservation, adjacency.
- **order of operations**: sequence matters; earlier folds gate later possibilities.
- **stability check**: relaxed energy finds the witnessed 3d.
- **observability**: what becomes hidden vs exposed defines the phenomenon we name.

---

## experiments to run

- **toy world**: start with a 2d cellular automaton; define fold rules that create occlusion layers; see if 3d-like behaviors (shadows, cavities, collisions) emerge.
- **vision test**: render the same 2d pattern under different fold grammars; measure human depth judgments; does grammar alone induce stable 3d perception?
- **information packing**: encode two independent 2d messages in layered folds; recover each via controlled unfolding; test capacity vs crease complexity.
- **physics hint**: impose conservation (area, angle) and see which macroscopic laws appear as invariants across folds.

---

## provocations

- maybe "matter" is what resists unfolding.
- maybe "force" is differential curvature concentration along a crease network.
- maybe "identity" is a stable crease pattern that survives perturbation.

---

## if this is true, what changes?

- **design**: to create volume, write grammars, not meshes.
- **computation**: optimize routing of folds, not brute simulation of bulk.
- **learning**: teach models crease discovery: minimal rules that maximize stable forms.
- **ethics**: some folds hide harms. visibility is a choice; unfolding is accountability.

---

## open edges

- how do independent fold systems compose without tearing?
- is there a "Dunbar's number" for crease interactions before coordination costs dominate?
- can folds self-organize: local rules → global, layered architectures?

---

## one-sentence take

3d is a story 2d tells when it learns to keep secrets in layers.
