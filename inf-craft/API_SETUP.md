## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- Make sure the API key starts with `sk-or-v1-`
- Check that you have credits in your OpenRouter account
- Verify the API key is correctly copied to `.env`

### 401 Unauthorized Error

## Cost Information

OpenRouter offers:
- **Free tier**: Limited requests per month

- **Pay-as-you-go**: Pay only for what you use

The AI Infinite Craft game uses minimal tokens per request, so costs are typically very low.

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your API key is correct
3. Ensure you have sufficient credits
4. Try the offline mode if AI mode isn't working

The game works perfectly in offline mode, so you can enjoy it immediately! ðŸŽ®
