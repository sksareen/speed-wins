# LLM Efficiency: Modular Optimization Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap provides a module-based approach to achieving instant-feeling AI responses through systematic optimization. Each module builds on previous learnings, allowing you to move at your own pace based on validation results, not arbitrary timelines.

**Core Objective**: Minimize response time to achieve seamless, instant user experience while maintaining acceptable quality.

**Key Principle**: Measure → Implement → Validate → Iterate

## Module 0: Measurement Infrastructure (Foundation)

### Goal
Can't optimize what you can't measure. Build comprehensive profiling infrastructure.

### Implementation Tasks
1. **Latency Profiling Harness**
   ```python
   # Components to measure:
   - Tokenization time
   - Model loading time
   - Attention computation
   - FFN computation
   - Memory transfers
   - Decoding/sampling time
   ```

2. **Quality Metrics Framework**
   - Perplexity measurement
   - Task-specific accuracy (your use cases)
   - Human preference alignment
   - Regression detection

3. **A/B Testing Infrastructure**
   - Request routing
   - Metric collection
   - Statistical significance testing
   - Automatic rollback on regression

4. **Baseline Measurements**
   - GPT-4: Quality ceiling, latency floor
   - GPT-3.5: Balanced baseline
   - Current system: Starting point

### Exit Criteria
- Clear bottleneck identification (where is 80% of latency?)
- Baseline metrics established
- Can measure impact of any optimization

## Module 1: Small Model Baseline

### Goal
Establish floor performance with minimal compute. Understand the size/quality/speed tradeoff curve.

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Deploy Smallest Viable Models**
   ```python
   models_to_test = {
       "Qwen2.5-0.5B": {"params": 0.5B, "context": 32k},
       "Phi-3-mini": {"params": 3.8B, "context": 128k},
       "Gemma-2-2B": {"params": 2.6B, "context": 8k},
       "Llama-3.2-1B": {"params": 1.2B, "context": 128k}
   }
   ```

2. **Profile Each Model**
   - Tokens per second
   - First token latency
   - Memory usage
   - Quality on YOUR tasks

3. **Task Complexity Mapping**
   - Simple queries (classification, extraction) → Smallest models
   - Medium complexity (summarization, QA) → Medium models
   - Complex reasoning → Larger models
   - Create decision tree

4. **Optimization Techniques**
   - Compile with torch.compile()
   - Use ONNX runtime
   - Implement continuous batching
   - Test different precision (FP16, BF16)

### Exit Criteria

## Module 2: Attention Optimization Deep Dive

### Goal
Master attention efficiency techniques. Understand when each optimization applies.

### 2.1: FlashAttention Implementation

**Theory**: Memory bandwidth, not compute, is the bottleneck.

**Implementation**:
```python
# Standard Attention: O(N²) memory
attention = (Q @ K.T) / sqrt(d)
attention = softmax(attention)
output = attention @ V

# FlashAttention: O(N) memory via tiling
# Fused kernels, online softmax
import flash_attn
output = flash_attn.flash_attn_func(Q, K, V)
```

**Validation**:
- Memory usage reduction (should see 10-20x)
- Speed improvement (2-4x typical)
- Numerical equivalence check

### 2.2: Linear Attention

**Theory**: Replace softmax with feature maps for O(N) complexity.

**Implementations to Try**:
```python
# Performer-style (Random Features)
def random_features(x, num_features=256):
    W = torch.randn(x.shape[-1], num_features)
    return torch.exp(x @ W - 0.5 * (x ** 2).sum(-1, keepdim=True))

# RWKV-style (Linear RNN)
def rwkv_attention(Q, K, V, state):
    for t in range(seq_len):
        state = decay * state + K[t] @ V[t].T
        output[t] = Q[t] @ state
```

**Quality Analysis**:
- Which tasks maintain quality?
- Where does linear attention fail?
- Hybrid opportunities?

### 2.3: Sparse Patterns

**Patterns to Implement**:
```python
# Local Attention (window size W)
mask = torch.ones(N, N)
for i in range(N):
    mask[i, max(0, i-W):min(N, i+W)] = 1

# Dilated Attention (dilation rate D)
for i in range(N):
    mask[i, i::D] = 1

# BigBird (local + global + random)
mask = local_mask | global_mask | random_mask
```

**Profiling**:
- Sparsity vs quality tradeoff
- Optimal patterns for different sequence lengths
- Memory savings quantification

### 2.4: Comparative Analysis

Create benchmark on YOUR data:
| Method | Latency | Memory | Quality | Best For |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Standard | Baseline | O(N²) | 100% | Short sequences |
| Flash | 0.3x | O(N) | 100% | All GPU tasks |
| Linear | 0.1x | O(N) | 85-95% | Long sequences |
| Sparse | 0.2x | O(sN) | 90-98% | Structured data |

### Exit Criteria
- 5-10x attention speedup achieved
- Know which attention type for which use case
- Can implement custom attention patterns

## Failure Recovery Patterns

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Quality Drop Too Severe**

**Latency Still High**
- Profile with finer granularity
- Check memory bandwidth saturation
- Try more aggressive quantization
- Consider different hardware

**Memory Constraints**
- Implement KV cache eviction
- Use INT4 quantization
- Try sparse attention patterns
- Enable gradient checkpointing

**Complexity Overwhelming**
- Start with pre-built solutions (vLLM, TGI)
- Focus on one optimization at a time
- Use existing implementations first
- Simplify to essential components

**Routing Overhead Too High**
- Cache routing decisions
- Use smaller classifier
- Batch routing predictions
- Pre-compute for common queries

---

## Key Success Principles

1. **Validation-Driven Development**
   - Every optimization must show measurable improvement
   - If it doesn't help YOUR use case, skip it

2. **Fail Fast, Learn Faster**
   - 1-2 day experiment cycles maximum
   - Document failures—they're valuable data
   - Pivot quickly when approach isn't working

3. **Understanding > Implementation**
   - Know WHY something works, not just HOW
   - Be able to predict when it will/won't help
   - Build intuition through experimentation

4. **Composable Learning**
   - Each module builds on previous knowledge
   - Combine techniques for multiplicative gains
   - No module is wasted—even "failures" teach

5. **Production-Oriented**
   - Always tie back to real-world impact
   - Consider deployment constraints early
   - Measure what users actually experience
