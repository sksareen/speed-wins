# intelligence scaffolding

what if there was a scaffhold for intelligence.

the future is small models that perform individual functions

agents are simply models with instructions

## dialogue: building out the vision

**Core thesis:** Intelligence isn't monolithic - it's modular, composable, and task-specific.

**Question 1:** If agents are "models with instructions," what's the minimal viable instruction set? Do we need:
- Goal specification
- Tool access definitions  
- Success criteria
- Memory/context rules

Or is it even simpler?

**Theory A: The Unix Philosophy for AI**
What if we applied Unix principles - "do one thing well" - to model design? Each model becomes a pipe-able component:
- Sentiment analyzer | summarizer | decision maker
- Code parser | vulnerability detector | patch generator

**Question 2:** Where does "intelligence" actually live in this system?
- In the individual models?
- In the orchestration layer?
- In the instruction set?
- Or does it emerge from the interactions?

**Theory B: Intelligence as Routing**
Maybe the real intelligence is knowing WHICH model to invoke WHEN. Like a neural router that pattern-matches problems to specialized solvers. The scaffolding becomes a dispatch system.

**Provocation:** What if we're thinking about this backwards? Instead of making models smarter, what if we made problems "dumber" - decomposing them into atomic operations that simple models can handle?

**Question 3:** How small is too small? 
At what point does the coordination overhead exceed the benefit of specialization? Is there a "Dunbar's number" for model orchestration?

**Wild idea:** What if models could spawn sub-agents dynamically? Self-organizing hierarchies based on problem complexity?

## Discovery Vector: Decomposed Intelligence Architecture

### The Shift We're Seeing
- **From:** Monolithic "do-everything" models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- **To:** Orchestrated micro-models with narrow expertise
- **Why now:** We've hit diminishing returns on "just make it bigger"

### Key Insights Emerging

**1. The Unix Parallel is Perfect**
- `ls | grep | awk` → `parse | analyze | generate`
- Composability > Capability
- Each model does ONE thing, but does it perfectly
- Standard interfaces (text in, text out) enable infinite combinations

**2. Intelligence Location Paradox**
The intelligence might not be IN any component:
- Individual models: Just pattern matchers
- Orchestration layer: Just routing logic  
- Instructions: Just configuration
- **The magic:** Emerges from the interaction patterns

Like how your brain's intelligence isn't in any single neuron, but in the firing patterns across billions of them.

**3. Minimal Viable Agent (MVA)**
Strip away everything. What's left?
```
{
  "trigger": "when to activate",
  "transform": "input → output mapping",
  "handoff": "where to send result"
}
```
That's it. Everything else is complexity we've added.

**4. Problem Decomposition > Model Intelligence**
Instead of making smarter hammers, what if we got better at turning everything into nails?
- Complex task → atomic operations
- Each atomic op → specialized micro-model
- Coordination → simple routing rules

### The Fascinating Part

This mirrors biological evolution:
- Single-cell → multi-cell organisms
- General neurons → specialized regions (visual cortex, motor cortex)
- Individual intelligence → collective intelligence (ant colonies, human societies)

We're witnessing AI evolve the same modular architecture that life itself discovered.

### Open Questions That Keep Me Up

1. **Is there a "Dunbar's number" for model orchestration?** 
   - Human groups collapse beyond ~150 members
   - Is there a similar limit for model coordination?

2. **Can models self-organize?**
   - Could they form temporary hierarchies based on task complexity?
   - Spawn specialists when needed, dissolve when done?

3. **What's the atomic unit of intelligence?**
   - Is it smaller than we think?
   - Could it be as simple as "if X then Y"?

4. **The routing problem**
   - Who decides which model handles what?
   - Could the router itself be a micro-model?
   - Routers all the way down?

### Next Explorations

**Experiment idea:** Build the simplest possible scaffolding
- 3-5 micro-models
- Dead simple routing logic
- See what emerges

**Theory to test:** Intelligence is 90% routing, 10% computation

**Wild speculation:** The future isn't AGI. It's AMI - Artificially Modular Intelligence. Billions of tiny, perfect specialists, coordinating like a massive neural democracy.
