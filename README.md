3. **React frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd inf-craft
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## üîç Validation Checkpoints

After each module, validate:
1. **Performance**: Did we improve speed? By how much?
2. **Quality**: What's the quality degradation? Is it acceptable?
3. **Understanding**: Can you explain WHY it works?
4. **Generalization**: Will this work for your other use cases?
5. **Next Step**: What's the next bottleneck to tackle?

## üéØ Key Principles

1. **Validation-Driven**: Each module must show measurable improvement
2. **Fail Fast**: Quick experiments, rapid iteration
3. **Understanding > Implementation**: Know WHY something works
4. **Composable Learning**: Each module builds on previous
5. **Production-Oriented**: Always tie back to real-world impact
